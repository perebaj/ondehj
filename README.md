To run the API locally and start shipping ðŸš¢ new features is easy:


```bash
# start running the development environment. For now, a PostgreSQL database.
make dev/start
```

After that, to run the API, apply the command:

```go
go run cmd/ondehoje/main.go
```

# API Requests

Just access your browser at http://localhost:8000/docs. That's it, all routes grouped in one place!


# Core Concepts
Some concepts that this simple API will build under:


* API
* Database
* Database Migration
* Structured Logs
* Dev Container environment
* Go Unit test
* Metrics
* Swagger/OpenAPI

# Heroku Database

Before connecting to the PostgreSQL database, make sure you have the [Heroku CLI installed](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)

```bash
sudo apt-get install postgresql  #to install psql

heroku pg:psql -a ondehoje # to access database and execute admin commands
```

# Ship New code to production

Although there is a CI for that, it's possible to SHIPðŸš€ new code to production just using your machine.

Just run the following commands, in this order, and be happyðŸ˜ƒ:

```
make image
make publish
make heroku/release

```
